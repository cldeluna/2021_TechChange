# The only constant is change

All change is disruptive, there will always be the leaders,  the followers,  and the nay sayers.
If you don't agree, support your argument with facts & data.

## The Human Component
I'll focus on Technical Change but it is important to remember that technical change often leads to organizational change. 
Often that is the most challenging.

Tremendous driving force.

Sometimes immediacy results in a tradeoff  more important than quality

# Managing Change & Adoption

Throughout your career you will likely be both the changer and the changee.

In my experience the most important questions to ask are:

- What problem am I trying to solve? 
- Which forces are in play? 
- When is the time to change?
