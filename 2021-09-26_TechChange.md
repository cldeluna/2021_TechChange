# The only constant is change

All change is disruptive, there will always be the leaders,  the followers,  and the nay sayers.
If you don't agree, support your argument.

Tremendous driving force.

- Film to Digital
- Wired to Wireless
- Messages, Voicemail,  Pagers, Texts,  Rich Cross Platform "Texting"
- spatial applications -> Thomas Guides, MapQuest on your computer,  portable GPS and Maps

Sometimes immediacy results in a tradeoff  more important than quality

# The bigger picture
- These are tools and they can't substitute excellence in your disciple...they can help tremendously
- Be open to technical change
- Up to you to use them to make your life easier or not

Be open to it, see if it makes your job easier,  is it its time?
